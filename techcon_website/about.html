        <h2>History</h2>
        <h3>The Journey of TechCon</h3>
        <p>
          TechCon began in 2005 as a small gathering of local tech enthusiasts
          in a university auditorium. Born from a shared passion for innovation,
          its inaugural theme, "Connecting Tomorrow's Technology," aimed to
          bridge the gap between academic research and industry application.
          Over the past two decades, TechCon has evolved into a premier global
          event, attracting thousands of attendees and featuring groundbreaking
          presentations. From its humble beginnings focused on early internet
          technologies to today's exploration of AI, quantum computing, and
          sustainable tech, TechCon has consistently been at the forefront of
          technological discourse, fostering collaboration and sparking
          countless innovations.
